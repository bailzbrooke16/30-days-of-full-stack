# Create New Project

**You develop apps in the context of an Angular workspace.**

To create a new workspace and initial starter app:

1. Run the CLI command `ng new` and provide the name `my-app`, as shown here:

   ```shell
   ng new my-app
   ```

2. The `ng new` command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app. Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key.

3. The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular npm packages and other dependencies. This can take a few minutes.

4. The CLI creates a new workspace and a simple Welcome app, ready to run.
