# Welcome

We are super excited that you are ready to embark on this journey into all the technologies you are going to need to get going.

## Before We Get Going

- Understand that this is not a once of use site. Keep referencing back to this as you need and want as you work.
- The playbook is setup in a specific fashion. Each section is for a different technology. Each section is broken up as per below
  - Outline of the technology
  - How to Install
  - Recipes ( these are repeatable common actions)
  - Tutorials

## Things To Keep In Mind

Keep in mind that this guide is always a work in progress and work is easier with more hands. If you see something that isn't correct or have
suggestions you think are a better way of doing something then suggest it or create a PR for it and lets all build this ultimate playbook.

## You Want to Contribute?

Great here are some tips you need to get this documentation up and running and you can make all the changes you would like.



### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to clone the repository and push updates

### Clone the repository

Start by cloning this repo onto your PC by running this command

```bash
clone https://github.com/bailzbrooke16/30-days-of-full-stack.git
cd 30-days-of-full-stack
```


## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd 30-days-of-full-stack
npm i
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm i` command installs all the npm packages required for the application.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
